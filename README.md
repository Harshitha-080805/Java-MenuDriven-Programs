# Java Menu-Driven Program

This repository contains a **menu-driven Java program** that demonstrates basic operations on integers and arrays.  
The program uses modular static methods to perform different tasks based on the user’s choice.

## Features

- 📌 Display two integer values  
- ➕ Find the sum of two integers  
- 📃 Print array elements  
- 🔄 Return the array  
- ✖️ Multiply array elements by 2  
- ➕ Calculate sum of array elements  
- 🔼 Find maximum element in the array  
- 🔽 Find minimum element in the array  

## How It Works

1. The program displays a list of algorithm steps.  
2. User is prompted to enter a choice (1–8).  
3. Based on the choice, the respective operation is performed.  
4. The process continues until the user exits by entering a number greater than 8.
